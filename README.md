**LAB CYCLE**

**Day 1.**

a) Familiarise the basics of network configuration files and networking commands

in Linux.

● /etc/init.d/network

● /etc/sysconfig/network

● /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts

● /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifcfg-eth0

● /etc/nsswitch.conf

● /etc/hosts

Study the above commands and identify the suitable command from the above list for the

following purposes:

Imagine you as a system administrator of a company A123.

i) You have multiple network interface cards in your system. You need to provide

additional configuration for only the first NIC.

ii) You need to control searches for users, IP addresses and group information.

iii) You need to specify routing and host information for the network interfaces

b) Familiarise the Linux Networking Commands:

● Ping

● Ifconfig

● Traceroute

● Netstat

● Nslookup

● Route

● Host

● Iwconfig

● Hostname

● nload

Study the above commands and identify the suitable command from the above list for performing the following:

i) Test whether “Google” is up and accessible

ii) Send 5 messages of buffer size 1000 bytes to any URL.

iii) List all UDP Sockets.

iv) Print the IP address details of the google.com

v) Display the hostname of your computer.

**Day 2.**

Familiarize and understand the use and functioning of system calls used for network

programming in Linux.

i) Process management: Write a C program to implement fork, exec, getpid, exit and wait
